# Course-3-Project-Assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The objective of this project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Data Sets
1.- The following link must be download and unzip the file to access to the file: UCI HAR Dataset where are all files:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

#Files in this Repository
1. R scrip called run_analysis.R (which need package reshape2 to use melt and dcast function).
2. A .txt file where tidy data that shows the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. A code book where all variables are describe and overall of the transformations performed as well.
