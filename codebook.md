OVERALL INFORMATION:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

DESCRIBE VARIABLES:

The file tidy.txt contains 81 variables and 180 observations that shows the average
of each variable for each activity and each subject.

subject = ID of each person or subject

activity = activity that was performed by each person “subject”
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

TRANSFORMATIONS:

1.- From the file feature only the measurements of the mean and std deviation were extracted and the names variables of this measurement were stored in object ext_feature.names.
2.- The columns of file X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt were merge with function cbind as test_df.
3.- 2.- The columns of file X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt were merge with function cbind as train_df.
4.- test and train rows (test_df and train_df) were merge using rbind function and store this new data frame in an object called df.
5.- Column names were given to df data set with function colnames(df) c(“subject","activity",ext_feature.names).
6.- Data set df was melt so that each row has its unique id-subject that represents to each person that perform the experiment.
7.- Then with dcast function we get the mean of each variable for each activity and each person.
